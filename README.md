# Scheduling-Simualtion
This assignment on uniprocessor scheduling requires students to write simulators for different scheduling algorithms and analyze their performance. In Part I, students are tasked with simulating non-preemptive scheduling algorithms, such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Process-Next (SPN), and non-preemptive priority, comparing their average waiting, turnaround, and response times. Part II involves implementing a preemptive Round Robin scheduler and analyzing its performance across various time quanta sizes. Part III asks students to simulate the shortest remaining time algorithm using exponential averaging and evaluate its effectiveness with different alpha values. The results must be presented in a report with graphs and observations.
